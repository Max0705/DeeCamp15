# DeeCamp15
Codes for the project "Image Generation Based on Text Semantics" at DeeCamp. In this project, we make the following contributions:
1, Skecth generation (GIF) given a word as an input;
2, Picture colorization given a sketch as an input;
3, Simple semantics for combined sketch generation;
4, Word guess through description.
Our final goal is generating a sketch GIF and colorize it when description of labels is given.
